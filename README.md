# Geospatial Analysis
## Vector_manipulation
This folder contains a Python script for vector data manipulation. The primary functionalities of this script include:

1. **Buffer Creation:** It reads a shapefile and generates a buffer around the features within the shapefile. You can specify the buffer distance in feet, making it highly customizable for various applications. This is particularly useful for tasks like proximity analysis or creating zones of influence around specific geographic objects.

2. **Reprojection:** The script also offers the ability to reproject a shapefile, which can be essential when working with data from different coordinate systems. Reprojection ensures that data is in a consistent coordinate system, which is often necessary for geospatial analysis and visualization.
